The documentation is generated through DOCCO (http://jashkenas.github.io/docco/).
To generate the documentation:

1. Install DOCCO: npm install -g docco
2. From cygwin command prompt, run something like "docco documentation/*.litcoffee"

Files generate to scr/docs


Notes
----
- Use cygwin as standard windows command prompt. Windows can't handle the any (*) character well
- DOCCO does not copy the image files over to the output folder. You have to do that manually.
